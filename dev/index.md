# hubEnsembles

The goal of hubEnsembles is to provide standard implementations of
commonly used methods for ensembling model outputs. The hubEnsembles
package is part of [the hubverse
project](https://docs.hubverse.io/en/latest/) and expects all input data
to the key functions to be formatted as an object of a [`model_out_tbl`
class](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubUtils/reference/as_model_out_tbl.html).
