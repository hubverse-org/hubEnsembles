  model_out_tbl,
  weights = NULL,
  weights_col_name = "weight",
  model_id = "hub-ensemble",

}
\arguments{
\item{model_out_tbl}{an object of class \code{model_out_tbl} with component
model outputs (e.g., predictions).}

\item{weights}{an optional \code{data.frame} with component model weights. If
provided, it should have a column named \code{model_id} and a column containing
model weights. Optionally, it may contain additional columns corresponding
to task id variables, \code{output_type}, or \code{output_type_id}, if weights are
specific to values of those variables. The default is \code{NULL}, in which case
an equally-weighted ensemble is calculated. Should be prevalidated.}

\item{weights_col_name}{\code{character} string naming the column in \code{weights}
with model weights. Defaults to \code{"weight"}}

\item{model_id}{\code{character} string with the identifier to use for the
ensemble model.}

\item{task_id_cols}{\code{character} vector with names of columns in
\code{model_out_tbl} that specify modeling tasks. Defaults to \code{NULL}, in which
case all columns in \code{model_out_tbl} other than \code{"model_id"}, \code{"output_type"},
\code{"output_type_id"}, and \code{"value"} are used as task ids.}

\item{n_samples}{\code{numeric} that specifies the number of samples to use when
calculating quantiles from an estimated quantile function. Defaults to \code{1e4}.}

\item{...}{parameters that are passed to \code{distfromq::make_q_fn}, specifying
details of how to estimate a quantile function from provided quantile levels
and quantile values for \code{output_type} \code{"quantile"}.}
}
\value{
a \code{model_out_tbl} object of ensemble predictions. Note that any
additional columns in the input \code{model_out_tbl} are dropped.

\description{
Compute ensemble model outputs as a linear pool, otherwise known as a
distributional mixture, of component model outputs for
each combination of model task, output type, and output type id. Supported
output types include \code{mean}, \code{quantile}, \code{cdf}, and \code{pmf}.
}
\details{
The underlying mechanism for the computations varies for different
\code{output_type}s. When the \code{output_type} is \code{cdf}, \code{pmf}, or \code{mean}, this
function simply calls \code{simple_ensemble} to calculate a (weighted) mean of the
component model outputs. This is the definitional calculation for the CDF or
PMF of a linear pool. For the \code{mean} output type, this is justified by the fact
that the (weighted) mean of the linear pool is the (weighted) mean of the means
of the component distributions.

When the \code{output_type} is \code{quantile}, we obtain the quantiles of a linear pool
in three steps:
\enumerate{
\item Interpolate and extrapolate from the provided quantiles for each component
model to obtain an estimate of the CDF of that distribution.
\item Draw samples from the distribution for each component model. To reduce
Monte Carlo variability, we use quasi-random samples corresponding to
quantiles of the estimated distribution.
\item Collect the samples from all component models and extract the desired
quantiles.
}

Steps 1 and 2 in this process are performed by \code{distfromq::make_q_fn}.
