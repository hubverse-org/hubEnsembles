The goal of hubEnsembles is to provide standard implementations of commonly used methods for ensembling model outputs. The hubEnsembles package is part of [the hubverse project](https://hubverse.io/en/latest/) and expects all input data to the key functions to be formatted as an object of a [`model_out_tbl` class](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubUtils/reference/as_model_out_tbl.html).
